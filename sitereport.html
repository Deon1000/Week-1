        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Within this module i have experianced working with HTML and CSS which personally i think are much nicer languages to learn compared to a language like python. Personally i chose to use Visual studio code for this module which i used before.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">I think one thing i found very difficult was managing all the various files at one point in the assignment i had a different css file for every for every HTML file which made managing all the different pages extremely difficult.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 1.5em;">When referring to the development of the site theres been different aspects like using Github and commiting throughout this process which was a new type of challenge, navigating something i wasnt used to previously. For the design i made the decision to go for a darker looking website utilising black, grey and purple as the three main colours on the website which meant for a more darker gloomy tone in the visual aspect of the design. If you see the header of the Website you will notice that a different font is used and that font that i used is called karla, i chose this font because i thought it was nice block like font</p>
